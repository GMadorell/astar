Astar
=============

This project consists on the implementation of the Astar algorithm (and also the BFS one, which is a simplification of A*).
It's made in python and tested under it's version 2.7.3.

Dependencies: wxPython if you want to see the GUI.

Usage: gui_metro.py for the UI or Main.py if you prefer good old console testing.
